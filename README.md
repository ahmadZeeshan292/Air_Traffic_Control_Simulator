## üß† Abstract

The primary goal of this project was to develop an **airplane ground surface traffic control system** using the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. The emphasis was not on merely achieving output but on producing a thoughtfully architected solution. Students were encouraged to develop a flexible, extensible codebase to meet the project‚Äôs complex requirements using OOP principles like **encapsulation**, **reusability**, and **abstraction**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

To implement this system, we first understood the problem demands: tracking aircraft, managing their routes, optimizing paths, and coordinating safe landings while avoiding collisions. Below is a breakdown of each major class and its function in the solution.

---

### ‚è± Timer Class

The `Timer` class serves two vital purposes:
- **Global Clock:** Acts as the central clock around which the simulation runs.
- **State Controller:** Tracks the airplane‚Äôs current state based on time, allowing the traffic control system to make decisions based on real-time aircraft positions.

This functionality was critical in preventing collisions and managing timed transitions between states.

### ‚úàÔ∏è Airplane Class

The `Airplane` class is the core of the system. It replicates key aircraft behaviors:
- **Attributes:** Departure, destination, speed, status, and more.
- **Integration with Timer:** Transitions aircraft states according to time intervals.
- **Key Functions:**

#### `planedistancetime(Countries_runway_gateway_status Status)`

Determines when a plane should change its status based on predefined time intervals and current air/ground conditions. The function works closely with the traffic control system to ensure safe transitions.

#### `calculate_shortest_path()`

Uses the `greedy_alg` class to compute the most efficient route between origin and destination using weighted costs. If no valid path exists, the airplane remains grounded.

#### States Enum:
```java
enum E_AirplaneState {
  Grounded,
  Destination_runway,
  Destination_gateway,
  Departure_runway,
  Departure_gateway,
  Mid_air,
  Descending
}
